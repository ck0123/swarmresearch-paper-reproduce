## Lens: linguistic/semantic content of drafted vs. corrected tokens

Orthogonal to acceptance rates, draft-depth/run-length, gamma sweeps, timing, output
length, latent geometry, input structure, and determinism. Question studied: *what kind of
tokens does the MTP draft get wrong, and what does the target substitute?* — the content
identity of draft vs. correction, not the rate at which it happens.

### Method
Instrumented `initial_program.cpp` (mtp-spec mode) to emit one JSON line per verification
round to a side-channel file (`results/content_<gpu>.jsonl`); stdout is unchanged so scoring
is unaffected (full run: accuracy 93.3%, identical to target reference; 1.48x speedup).
Each line records the detokenized piece string of every draft token with its accept flag,
plus the correction token (on a rejection) or bonus token (on full-accept). Post-analysis in
`analyze_content.py` classifies pieces into coarse linguistic categories
(word/punct/digit/space/newline/special) and computes substitution structure.
Full 30-item run on GPUs 6,7: **65,830 rounds — 26,866 corrections, 38,964 full-accept bonus**.

### Core facts

**1. The draft's failure mode is lexical, not structural (near-miss dominance).**
72.4% of corrections are *same-category*: the draft picked the right token KIND but the wrong
specific token (word→word 53%, punct→punct 14%, digit→digit 3%). Only 27.6% are category
errors. The draft reliably knows the local linguistic shape of what comes next; it fails on
the lexical choice within that shape.

**2. Draft is right on scaffolding, wrong on content.**
Accepted draft tokens: 38.8% word, 33.3% punct, 15.0% digit, 8.4% space, 4.5% newline.
Rejected/correction tokens: ~64–67% word, ~25% punct, ~4% digit. Punctuation, whitespace, and
newlines are accepted far above their share of corrections; content words are the dominant
correction category. Digits are accepted well relative to frequency (15% of accepts, 4% of
corrections).

**3. "Same category" does NOT mean "similar spelling."**
81.9% of corrections share ZERO character prefix with the rejected draft; only ~4% share ≥2
chars. The draft proposes a *different word of the same type*, not a typo/morphological
variant. Errors are semantic substitutions, not spelling slips.

**4. Divergences are mostly at word/line boundaries (which-word branch points).**
60.0% of corrections: both rejected-draft and correction begin a new word/line (boundary).
28.0% are both word-internal (mid-word divergence); of those only 17.7% share a stripped
prefix. Branch points are about *which next word/symbol*, not intra-word spelling.

**5. Concrete recurring substitutions** (rejected → correction):
- Formatting ambiguity: `\n`↔`\n\n` (paragraph-break length), `.`↔`,`, `$.`↔`$`/`$,`.
- Function-word / determiner choice: ` the`↔` a`↔` it`↔` this`; `the`→`a` is the single most
  common word substitution (89×).
- Reasoning-step direction: `Wait`↔`Let`, `let`→`I`, `is`→`can`/`means`/`was` — disagreement
  on how to open the next clause/reasoning move.
- Math-mode transition: ` $`↔` the`, ` $`↔` `` ` `` — the draft mis-predicts entry/exit of
  LaTeX math. `$`-bearing tokens: 11,195 accepted vs 2,052 rejected-draft, 1,868 in corrections.
- Digit value guesses: `1`↔`2`, `2`↔`1`, `1`↔`0`/`3` — adjacent-value misses where the draft
  cannot know the computed number.

**6. Domain content profile (correction category mix).**
Math (aime) and code (lcb) corrections are punctuation/digit-heavy (aime 31.2% punct, 7.4%
digit; lcb 28.1% punct, 6.0% digit). Prose multiple-choice (hle 75.9% word, gpqa 72.0% word)
corrections are overwhelmingly word choice. Correction content tracks the symbolic density of
the domain.

**7. Post-divergence drafts stay content-heavy.**
Tokens drafted after the first rejection (discarded, conditioned on a wrong prefix) are 57.5%
word / 26.6% punct / 5.8% digit — the draft keeps proposing content words rather than
collapsing into filler after it goes off-path.

### Artifacts
- `initial_program.cpp` — added side-channel per-round content logging (mtp-spec only).
- `analyze_content.py` — content categorization + substitution-structure analysis.
- `results/content_6.jsonl`, `results/content_7.jsonl` — 65,830 logged rounds.
